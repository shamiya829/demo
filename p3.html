        This idea is feasible as there is a clear product market fit in relation to Shamiya's current experience working with startups. She can use her connections within the industry to create a platform that investors and startups can use to pitch and connect with each other. However, the TAM may be limited, and the cost and fundraising needs could be higher depending on how complex the platform needs to be.

        This idea is highly feasible as there is a clear product market fit in relation to Shamiya's skills in translation and her experience working with startups. She has experience translating content for marketing purposes and could offer a service specifically for startups that need translation services for their websites, marketing materials, and pitches. The TAM is large, but the cost to start may be high due to the need for multiple language experts. Shamiya would need a co-founder with language expertise and business skills to bring this idea to fruition.</td>

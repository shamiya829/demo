By creating a tech-enabled platform that can help bridge these gaps, Kolento can provide accessible quality education to the less fortunate. </li>
        <li>People Mission Fit (PMiF): 80 - With Kolento's past experience in founding an NPO, he has already demonstrated his ability to lead charitable endeavors. </li>
        <li>Market Potential: 85 - With the pandemic pushing education online and increasing awareness on the lack of accessible quality education, there is a definite demand for such a platform that caters to the niche of underprivileged communities.</li>

        <li>Fundraising Needs: 90 - With the right investors and partners, raising funds can be attainable with the right story and mission.</li>
        <li>Other Factors: 70 - Finding the right tech talent and partners to build a successful platform can be a challenge. Kolento needs to make sure that his platform's operations are scalable and within the legal bounds of the countries in which he plans to operate.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>The co-founders that Kolento should be looking for:</b> Kolento needs a co-founder that can help him build the tech and oversee its maintenance and scalability. It would help if he had a technical co-founder with experience in developing an education tech platform.</p>
